\title{Plot BFB-like Signatures Along the Genome}
\usage{
plot_bfb_signature(res, chr_of_interest, allele_of_interest)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A fitted object returned by the \code{fit()} function. It must contain the \code{reconstructions}
field populated via \code{compute_reconstructions()}.}

\item{chr_of_interest}{A character string indicating the chromosome to plot (e.g., \code{"8"} or \code{"X"}).}

\item{allele_of_interest}{A character string indicating the allele to analyze, typically \code{"A"} or \code{"B"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object displaying a bar plot where each bar corresponds to a genomic segment,
with its height and color intensity proportional to the number of BFB-like events affecting that segment.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the distribution of BFB-like events (asymmetric CN differences)
across genomic segments for a given chromosome and allele. The plot highlights which genomic
regions are most frequently affected by potential BFB events in the reconstructed phylogeny.
}
\details{
The function extracts the reconstructed merged profiles and identifies the internal nodes in the
phylogeny that show asymmetric copy number changes (i.e., delta > 0). It computes the difference
between the left and right child profiles for these nodes, identifies affected segments, and counts
the number of times each segment is involved in a BFB-like event. The output is a genomic bar plot
showing the number of BFB-like events per segment.
