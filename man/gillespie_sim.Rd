\description{
Simulates the evolution of cells undergoing Break-Fusion-Bridge cycles using
a continuous-time Gillespie algorithm. This function models cell birth and death
processes with the possibility of BFB events occurring during replication.
}
\details{
The function implements a Gillespie algorithm to simulate stochastic birth and death
processes with possible BFB events. Events occur at rates proportional to the number of cells
and depend on time since the last event. The simulation tracks cell lineages, creating
a phylogenetic history of BFB events.

BFB (Break-Fusion-Bridge) cycles are a mechanism of genomic instability where
chromosome breakage followed by fusion of broken ends creates genomic rearrangements.
Each BFB event produces two daughter cells with different rearranged sequences.

The phylogenetic information tracks whether each BFB event resulted in a sequence
length gain or loss for each affected cell lineage.
