\title{Process a birth event (diploid version)}
\usage{
process_birth_event(state, current_cell_id, lambda, rate)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{The simulation state containing cell information,
sequences, and parameters}

\item{current_cell_id}{ID of the cell undergoing birth/division}

\item{lambda}{Rate parameter for Poisson distribution used to sample
the number of genomic events per daughter cell}

\item{rate}{Rate parameter used in amplification/deletion simulations.
Length of event is sample from exponential distribution with parameter 1 / rate.}
}
\value{
Updated simulation state with new daughter cells and updated history
}
\description{
This function handles cell division by creating two daughter cells from a parent cell.
During division, various genomic events (amplifications, deletions, BFB) can occur
based on the specified rates and lambda parameter.
